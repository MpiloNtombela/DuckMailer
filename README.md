# DuckMailer

### What is it?
DuckMailer is a tool that automatically converts the target address to a valid duck address that DuckDuckGo™ will accept and forward the email to the target email address.

### Whats a @duck Address / Email protection?
DuckDuckGo's email protection assigns you a free “@duck.com” email address (e.g mpilo_at_duck_dot_com). Before forwarding the email to your personal inbox, your duck address filters out multiple types of hidden email trackers.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
                    "We remove most hidden trackers from incoming emails sent to this address, then forward them to your
                    regular inbox for safer reading. This means if you use an email service like Gmail or Yahoo, it’s no
                    problem! Emails
                    sent to your Personal Duck Address will arrive there as usual so you can read your email like
                    normal, in any app or on the
  web, worry-free." <b>-DuckDuckGo</b>
